Bitcoin: No 
You mean like when /u/coblee sold his stack for fear of conflicting interests?
Alot of people making sick gains right now. When the bubble ultimately does come the bull shit will fall to the wayside.
Vitalik should really point the finger at all those b.s. ERC20 token ICO's on the Ethereum block chain...majority of them are scam tokens.
Cryptocurrency is a failure. If you can't buy bread with it, it's not a currency. 
thats one hell of a PR photo
As long as he doesn't get to "You could have had paradise, but your greed has punctured the border of wickedness! I am abandoning the project! " then everything will work out fine. 
Possibly fix the horribly flawed and resource hungry current Mist/Geth problems?
Take this for the ominous warning, that the bubble is not sustainable, and we will enter the next phase of development.

The current bubble is a massive distraction. 

The quickest way to shake out the rats is to sink the ship, and raise it back up.
Nobody wants to tell the world how much money they have, and it’s my understanding that that is what ethereum does.

How is this not seen as a huge problem?
Translation: the revenge of centralized systems is upon us, all hail the new crypto overlord, Ripple.
when you've spent so much time in the blockchain

you head starts to look like a block


goddamint vitalik your head looks like a fookkkin block of cement you little homo twink sucker you suck dick for a cigarette you russian shit
I’m an ethereum app developer 

Cut me some slack yo
Is it just me or does he seem to whine and moan too much? Every article I read he is either threatening to leave ETH or moaning about people making money. Makes me want to backhand him. 
tfw your crypto is no longer #2.
his dickhead is starting to get a bit prickish 
Playa got his, fuck your PoW.  
As soon as you started insulting people I stopped reading your post
Unless your developers run on photosynthesis I don't think it would end well for the technology.

Vitalik seems just upset that the dirty stupid crowd is smelling money and is jumping in as we are talking. 

What is the result? A dramatic fall of the level of discourse because his audience is not exclusively composed of comp-sci majors and other libertarians/an-cap with an interest in tech anymore, now you have a lot of people wanting to make a quick buck and displaying no interest to educate themselves about what they buy, the worst part is that they are loud and pollute the discussions.

In short the secret club is no more and he is beginning to hate dumb people for that.
Damn eth is fine. The people tripping about ripple over taking eth are clueless.  Blue chips alts all 100x.

Eth is going through growing pains.  It's not a zero sums game. Focus on overall crypto market growth not on eth vs some coins.

Either the herd is overtaken by greed or people are missing the point.

don't be sad  your going only the 60% in a month because others did 400%

Lollllll
What's that got to with anything? He didn't say people shouldn't focus on profit, he said cryptocurrencies shouldn't. And he's absolutely right. There are thousands of shitcoins now and bitcoin hard forks coming by the day that provide nothing new. The only reason they exist is so their creators can offload them to traders to pump and dump.
Jealousy is a bitch. Vitalik is right
On paper - yes, in reallity - no.If he decides to dump his ETH, Ethereum will die reeeeeally quickly and probably will drop its price.
Somebody might say *"This comment is stupid"* or *"You might have the brain the size of a walnut."*, but that would be pointless and probably kind of mean.

What you really need to hear is though ***"Let go of whatever little game you're playing, because it's not serving you or the community". ***

If you're just some smhuck who doesn't actually care about what's being built, ok, then fine... whatever.

However, if you're at all invested into Ethereum whether that's financial/time/resources/mental, you should really examine yourself with that attitude, because plain and simple **"It sucks."** and literally serves NO ONE, including yourself.

# Get real.
Right. Fuck this nerd
Stopped reading after "for-filled."
No, it's not! As 98% of so called "investors" just *buy but never use* the different crypto tokens. Remember the days when the bitcoin subreddit told you: "Once the price hits the moon,  you won't need to exchange back to fiat"?
See where this lead to in 2017: Prices close to the moon for all major tokens and the biggest achievement we got in terms of use cases are cryptokitties on ethereum and 30$ transaction costs on the bitcoin Blockchain and shady gambling sites.

The price is driven purely by greed and speculation. The technology itself is not worth these billion dollars and I honestly doubt that more than 20% of the "investors" even understand the most basic underlying principles. The  same  people  that  always  argued  email  encryption  was too difficult to understand or use are nowadays heavily invested in crypto currencies.
