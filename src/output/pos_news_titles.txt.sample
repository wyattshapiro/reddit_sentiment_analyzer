All the tosspots focusing on Vitaliks wealth completely miss the point.

If the crypto you are supporting has a purpose it will garner interest in the real world therefore the capital will flow to it. All is measured on the merit and proper fundamentals and not twitterbot pump and dumps...
Too many trolls here.

Actually, the best think that could happen right now is a 1-2 year crypto-crisis in which those developers with an actual interest in blockchain technology (and not just the money) keep working on improving it. Having too much attention right now with the technology so immature is bad for the ecosystem.
* Price information is currently the most transparent and available information in the ecosystem  

* Dapp development is siloed and opaque  

* Ethereum exists to more widely distribute value with direct participation. That's happening with exchange

want more dapp talk? 

* give us more Dapps
* more guidance on creating dapps
* more tools
* more best practices
* more ways to track progress of existing dapp development (Medium effective for content publishing, NOT distribution, always cross-post here in /r/ethereum)  

shout out to Maker, who iterated for two years in total daylight, gave us tools along the way and delivered

**tldr:** Price  info is public. Dapp info is private and siloed. Can't get excited about what you cannot see.


   
Everyone here seems to be of the mind *"Well he is rich and already made his money"* 


I am not sure you guys get it... 


I am very very new to blockchain, and discovering the tech behind all this is like a revelation to me. It truly has the potential to change the world.... The fact that this kid was able to take blockchain tech, and build it in a way where you can make DAPPS is fucking mind blowing. 


Anyway, I am building miners and learning everything I can, not so much to become rich, but because it fascinates me, I belive in it, and it makes me excited. Also I love building PC's and manageing them *(I used to bot in WoW, it it really became more of a hobbie than playing the dam game)* So it just seems like a fit for me. 


Anyway, the general "he made his" attitude really has me down on this comunity. 
Respect for him for doing this!
Says the guy on the richest youngest people list...
Profit is meaningful
profit attracts talent so that the technology will surely survive. Like tech bubble, did burst but what left turely changed the course of mankind
I'm very happy that there are still people around like mr. Buterin, that realize that 'money' (be it fiat, crypto or bare gold) is nothing more than a practical exchange item. It has no value on it's own. 

Unfortunately the so called capitalistic approach tries to ignore the source of our well being: labour, resources of raw materials, services, ... and a lot of people talk like having money is being rich. Try eating money when you're hungry and you will see what I mean. There's an age old story about a king who wished everything he touches turned into gold. He died shortly after his wish was fulfilled...

I hope in deciding the future development of Ethereum, decisions will plain ignore the ideas of those who are in Ethereum pure as a money gaining investment. Decisions should be made to make the Ethereum blockchain as useable and practical as possible. 

If you look at Bitcoin on this moment: the value has risen not because it became so practical, but because it is failing. It is impossible that all the money pumped into BTC will ever get exchanged back to fiat. And I would not even think about accepting BTC as a means of payment for any goods or services I sell either.
Knowing that Bitcoin is no more than a means of exchange (for goods or other currency), everyone who is only a little sane can smell what will happen, unless Bitcoin can solve the problem of slowness & high fees in a very short term. If only a few people would have invested in bitcoins this wouldn't be a problem, but senseless 'popularity' drawed so much attention of people who actually have no clue, and only a few will make 'profit' at the end. Profit that in fact serves no one except those few...
Remember the economic value of something is nothing more than the price the biggest fool wants to pay for it... the real value is something you can't push.

The real value is only there if you can exchange the currency (fiat/crypto/anything else) for something you actually need. As long as it's a number in a graph, you can cheer as much as you want, you only cheer about air (well, actually about 'ether'/void, as air is something you actually need).

I hope the value of ETH will not rise the same way as bitcoin and instead it will become (or stay, imho;) the best worked out blockchain tech around (mainly due to it's founders actually having a view on how the world turns around). I see blockchain technology as an immature thing right now. Promises a lot, but we are not there yet. I hope mr. Buterin will keep up with the good work and will be able not to get demotivated by those who see Ethereum just as a method of gambling.
I agree with him,  since the harmful financial bubbles are the result of driving the price up without increasing the value of the product. This is caused by large numbers of uninformed people investing just to "hop on the ride" to make profits, very similar to what happened in crypto last months.

We all want the balloon to blow up as big as possible, but inflating it too fast will make it pop much faster.
Vitalik knows whats up. Respect to the guy.
I would think one of the first steps to cryptos achieving something meaningful is widespread adoption and public awareness. Price surges are a result of those two things. 
This is why Ethereum is great. The fact that it's a computing platform and not just a currency will only make it valuable as time goes on unlike something like Bitcoin. 
Send me your money so your conscience can be clear and you can focus on “achieving something meaningful”, I’ll take one for the team
The success of Ethereum has increased the number of douche bags in this forum.  That will happen with anything that gets popular though.  I know he will see through all the BS and keep working hard on Ethereum.  
I still think he was sent here from another galaxy to help humanity :). he is also correct in his statement. 
He's clearly thinking on another level from a seeming majority of people on crypto-related subs, and that saddens me, though I can't say I'm surprised.

The biggest and most sustainable profits, long term, will come *as a consequence* of building useful/meaningful things with this technology - and profit will be far from the only benefit. Y'all are myopic as fuck.
Distributed autonomous organizations are hard to explain to people, but 100x return on investment is easy
I understand the sentiment but as presented, it is a **false dichotomy**.

There are profits to be made doing something meaningful for society.

In fact that is how markets work. We trade on the basis that the trade is mutually beneficial, and if everyone is trading this way, society as a whole benefits, as things move from those who value them less to those who value them more.

I don't think this is a bad thing. Prices right now are almost all driven by speculation. If the technology behind it proves, with time, to be a valuable real asset it will be good because then prices will be backed up by something more.than speculation. 
headline: Young impressionable genius finds out the truth about business 
The important thing being done is proving that crypto is useful and has a purpose. I'm not convinced any of these first round technologies will last but the are paving the way for sure.
The big focus these days for many people is simply profit.  Society appears so dark to me, and in many ways increasingly going in a direction I feel is wrong.  I believe the crypto world is achieving something meaningful simply for it's disruptive technological factor.  All of it is giving the younger generations a greater chance to understand the underlying mechanisms at play in this world through a greater transparency of systems of scalability.  This whole universe is energy and there's many different forms of 'coin' that energy comes in.  Learning these dynamics are spiritually enlightening to me.  It's kind of nice to be able to profit while learning and so it's meaningful to me.  If others miss this message for the sake of profit, well that's their loss.  Some carve meaning out of their existence here on Earth, some show others how not to.
When you completely agree but you also want to be rich
Like fast and reliable wallet. I still can't use Mist or Parity on my PC because it won't sync.
Most alt coins just talk about something meaningful 
Yeah, well for most of us that's exactly what crypto profits are : meaningful to us. 
just remember he didn't do it to get rich he liked the idea behind blockchain and the future it could provide, when you see him in public does he look like he has millions? you don't get much more down to earth than him really
Well yeah, I mean, there are few things that don't fit into that sentence.

The banking industry should focus less on profit, more on "achieving something meaningful"

Corporations should focus less on profit, more on "achieving something meaningful"

Humans should focus less on profit, more on "achieving something meaningful"
Easy to say when you’ve already made your fortune. I mean he’s not wrong, but I think he’d be better off continuing to lead by example.
Yes, resources should be devoted to endeavors that our shining leader deems important and meaningful, not to meeting the frivolous and decadent demands of consumers by profit seeking entities, he proclaims from atop his mountain of premined ether. 

Even if you set aside the China circa 1950 level of economic thought, no one's built anything he can be proud of because the infrastructure isn't there. Despite spending the last eighteen months insinuating at every turn that casper and sharding are just around the corner and whoah hey also swarm and whisper are going to decentralize everything, none of it is happening. The only thing they've managed to increase is, unsurprisingly, the price of Ether.
Yeah, these price memes are flooding into XRP as well, wtf!!!!
Pretty sure he wants more lambo memes and sharding jokes.  /s
There are so many investors on Reddit claiming they put their money into crypto because they "believe" in what is still an early, basically beta stage technology and who knows where it will be and which coins survive in 2-5 years. 

You don't invest in something that you "believe" in unless you have a lot of money to throw around. You do it because you want to make money. Even the rich rarely invest in something that they can't be sure will offer an acceptable return. You are no exception.

It's easy to say that probably less than 3% of these people who make this claim on Reddit don't care if the coin they invested in crashes and never recovers and that they will *only* regret that the coin did not flourish and "do great things for the world".

Come on. You aren't fooling anyone. You aren't the exception anymore than you have the ability to defy the laws of physics.
easy to say when you have billions of dollars worth of crypto
The insider trader talks about ethics... cute.
Well, nothing against Vitalik, but he already made his profits. 
PROFIT is a big word to overcome
Treat it as an ends in itself not a means to an end.

-kant

 The M-C-M fallacy

-Marx

Do something meaningful and the money will follow, 

That being said he can't be surprised that projects in the space multiplying wealth of people ten fold or more is drawing in attention from those who neither understand the tech nor have any interest in changing that fact. It's best to ignore those people, It's not his job to be a spokes person to investors.

It's not really one or the other.
But if you achieve something meaningful in the crypto realm, it will turn into profit
I'd say it's better to focus on money considering that "something meaningful" as of today means having a parallel currency which still hasn't faced the elephant in the room of how governments would enforce fiscal , monetary and debt policy if it gains traction .

Also isn't a bit too early to make the "Gates post DOJ" pivoting towards PR and political correctness?

Also doesn't the guy have various offices in Hong Kong for the only scope of minimizing his tax rate? 

Finally I'm not gonna accept sermons and life lessons from anybody , don't care if the guy is called Buterin or Gates or Musk or Obama or fucking Pope Francis fwiw , everybody is in the game for themselves and it is not a coincidence that people engaging in virtue signaling are always at the top of the global/local social pyramid and want to minimize the social hatred aimed at them by making PR stunts such as this
Wow, how deep.
The cryptocurrency world is too big now for controlled direction. It is like saying we should only use the internet for 'good', or mine uranium for nuclear power and not weapons.. Crypto is a tool/gift now, people will make their own decisions on how to use it. I only hope Vitalik, and his brilliant mind, and others like him, continue to develop it for meaningful purposes. I love the idea of a decentralised, trustless, open access currency, and I've invested in the idea. I don't think it's harmful to want to see some ROI? Especially in light of the risk of early adoption?
Vitalik, the philosipher and do-gooder, is using cryptocurrency to make the world good again. 

He says that afterrrr hes rich
I thought making money for wealthy/early investors was the only upside to crypto?  Want to do something meaningful, maybe do something other than work on what's only used as a toy for the rich.
Totally agree. The improvment upon daily life that can be made thru this tech should be the main focus. 
He has a great point, for himself. But most people only want to provide for their family and live a comfortable life.
Why do people believe cryptocommodities will replace reserve currencies when other, more liquid and secure commodities have not?
This exact reason is why I refused to invest into XRP. Profit would be nice, but I don't like a few things the company was doing in hopes of profiting from. 
Should I report this for price discussion ;-)
Why not both? I mean for me that is the biggest promise of smart contracts - that we can take that enormous power of human greed and somehow direct it so people will automatically help each other. It could work with something like Steemit (not actually Steemit ofcourse because unfortunatelly it's not decentralized but controled by oligarchy).
There are plenty of companies doing something meaningful. 
Respect 
 I want to contribute to achieving something meaningful but simply don't know how. 
I often try to think of the tech in ways which have not been realised yet but all that amounts are half baked ideas for a new shitcoin. 
I don't post lambo memes or invest in the latest pump and dump but struggle to be anything but part of the scenery. In part I'm here for the gains yes,of course, but I truthfully can say that I care about the future of this and if given a way I would fully participate in progressing the space. 
Dear Vitalik, don't get disheartened if it appears your but one of a few that are actually working for all of this, I suspect there are many more like myself that don't make much noise, yet wholeheartedly stand by you and your peers in this revolutionary quest. 
He want achieving something meaningful? Well how about  if he gives all hes erh to a man in a third world country? For me a third world man that  wil be meaningful
One word, bubble. Be safe all.
I don't see how more money into the crypto space is a problem. Frankly it seems like the development side is not meeting the needs of the people. Ethereum network slumped when crypto kitties launched. Really? A fucking game crashed your precious ether. I remember ether transactions being delayed 24hrs because of it. It sounds like Vitalek needs to stop talking about the price and focus on developing ether. Or we could just use a better coin. Like ubiq. Probably just solidifies an incoming bear market for crypto in general. The hype has been there for a year. Now it's time for devs and teams to take profits and start developing for the next couple years until the next wave of mainstream adoption.
What? Meaning? Ideals? I guess I'm out of here; I'm too poor to have the luxury of having those things. It doesn't matter how good my ideas and meaningful achievements are/can be if I'm starving on the street, or on the verge of being homeless. So many people went to college because they think they'll be achieving something meaningful end up being unhireable because they insist that they exist on the Earth not to be some drones on a corporate machine, but to "Achieve Something Meaningful"- they may have dreams, but then they keep on dreaming, until they dream forever.

What would be great would be the electronic currency that could be turned back into electrical power. A watt/hour equivalency. The first person to get a Kilowatt would be the first  Killionaire!


"If you build it they will come" is what I got from that.   Do something revolutionary with the protocols he developed and the profits will stay forever.  If not, it'll burn out like a fad.
When the smoke clears the proper value creating teams and companies will remain.
I disagree, focusing on profit keeps the money coming in enabling those with the right skills the ability through funding to further the technology
It's like he predicted today's Ripple rush.
why not both? Come for the profit, stay for the revolution.
this is the world of financial markets, I understand his peers in apps are producing lots of shit without producing anyone profits, but he can go on guilt free knowing he is contributing to the real fruits of our future labor, decentralized life, live it, love it
Tosh 3.0 over here lol
It’s Amazing how much meaning you can create when you have a ton of money. I suggest he puts his money where his mouth is. 
He has it all wrong it’s 

create cryptocoin
???
Profit

My exact thoughts Vitalik. I've been talking about this for a while now and. I even sent you an email about it not too long ago, but I'm not sure if you received it. Glad to hear something in that respect coming from someone in your position of the Cryptocurrency Arena
Lots of good quotes from Vitalik in http://strategiccoin.com/chronicles-1/. Tried to create a #VitalikSpeaks thread on Twitter, but haven't gotten any takers yet.
I would believe after he donates randomly all his wealthy and start working for food like some 'Jesus'
Let's keep this community tight and give Vitalik our support! The moon chasers are just in it for quick fix, I'm here to stay, say it with me! 
Good guy vitalick 
Vitalik is the epitome of the naive basement-dwelling redditor. The guy is brilliant, but his idealism is stifling.   
And that's his vision.

My goal is financial independence. Cryptocurrency just may be one of the paths to getting there. Profit means freedom. Therefore it is meaningful to me.
Well he is quite right to say that but looking at him he is the most richest young guy out there so it is easy to say that as well.
He should give away all his premined tokens if he believes this. Otherwise admit that personally enriching himself drove him to build Ethereum, and that's actually good.
No no no, people should DEFINITELY focus on profits. That's the incentive to bring something meaningful, making it valuable
Sorry but... profit is meaningful...
Easy to say when you’re rich. Fuck off
Cryptocurrencies currently do not have much real value but people are pumping a fuck ton of money into it because they think it's going to rise in value. That's extremely dangerous.

I've been saying it for a while but I do not see a real use case currently for Bitcoin. There are a few stores in Japan that accept Bitcoin but if that is their use case, then it's basically competing with the Suica card system that's already in place and already accepted for purchasing as well.

Also, why should anyone invest in one particular crypto over another? With hard currencies, you're betting on the stability and growth of a particular country's economy. With crypto, it is.... What?

Finally, what does it mean to actually buy crypto? To invest? But again, there isn't much hard real world value you're investing in: it's like investing in a startup that does nothing but have other investors invest in it.

Even though crypto has phenominal returns, I would never invest because I personally do not understand the value behind it.
Yo... it's called free markets... they innovate because they are driven by competition. "Buy my currency because I can't give it to you for free"... "c'mon guys it's about the movement"

Fuck that build something that people want to use enough to buy or shut up

I’m not a dev. Best I can do to support crypto is invest in projects like Ethereum. I don’t want to lose my money. There is nothing unnatural here. You focus on achieving something meaningful with your project. You are the one who came with this great thing and are capable of developing it. Hence why I gave you money and not the other way around. 
Profit IS ‘Something meaningful’
ok money skeleton whatever you say
Profit is meaningful, and profit gives business a reason to use it.


He really needs some basic business classes.
so what kind of name is vitalik? is that like vitality? like some rpg game where you have vilaty? why does his head look like a block of cement?
Not only that, but the article’s headline misconstrued his statement in the first place.

>Need to differentiate between getting hundreds of billions of dollars of digital paper wealth sloshing around and actually achieving something meaningful for society

**Nothing said about focusing on one over the other.** In fact he even goes on to say these two statements

>If all that we accomplish is lambo memes and immature puns about "sharting", then I WILL leave.

>Though I still have a lot of hope that the community can steer in the right direction.

>To be clear, the operative word here is "all". No, I won't stop or slow working on crypto just because price memes and stupid jokes exist - as long as there's also real social value that the ecosystem is working towards.
It's infuriating that the majority of people in this sub don't get this. Vitalik created Ethereum and I genuinely believe he has good intentions. The crypto dream has been corrupted by greed. We need real world value not just speculation. I would welcome a strong correction to flush these lambo-douches out. 
Except that every token being created faces the immediate label of being a pump and dump, get rich quick scheme. While I agree that most are, it’s becoming an increasing battle to make a case for making your own token as opposed to using the underlying blockchain coin. It’s even becoming to the point where you discuss ICO or crowdsale and you are immediate looked down upon. So unless, we expect projects with zero resources,  I’d be hard pressed to see any motivation for getting crypto other than to speculate. So what do we actually mean when we say purpose here?
That's why DBC - DeepBrainChain has my interest.  Only been available a couple days and will use block chain technology to create a supercomputer for calculating AI.


True, the Raiden-Token stunt is perfect example of people caring more about money than tech. This subreddit is spammed by bullshit moneygrabs on a daily. Time to stop this nonsense by a good old crash so people who only believe in the money side will lose interest.
Well, I think you might be right!

(both about the trolls & the crypto-crisis)
It would actually be good for innovation. A downturn in the market would make the existing infrastructure cheaper. 
Jumping on this to ask people how to learn how to create a dapp?
Hi all I just began writing dapps and love it so much more than traditional full stack development.

If you have ideas, questions, or want to talk. Send em anytime :)
Press 'F' to pay respects in ETH.
He got that way by thinking the way he does. Actual value is a better long bet than perceived value.

Bubble chasing is not smart investing.
So? Vitalik has always focused on the tech and has never been a pumper. He has every right to express this.
Rich people shouldn't complain about greed, because they're rich and hypocrites.


Poor people shouldn't complain about greed, because they're poor and jealous.


See what the people who crafted that discourse did there?
He did not say that. The article title did.

Vitamin said that there should be a distinction between price and actually doing something.

>Need to differentiate between getting hundreds of billions of dollars of digital paper wealth sloshing around and actually achieving something meaningful for society
What if I told you he became the one of the richest/youngest not because he wanted to be the richest/youngest but because he believed in his vision and followed his passion.
You guys are pretty stupid huh. He is talking about the necessary mindset to make crypto a lasting and widespread phenomena. Currently it doesn't work well enough for it to be reasonable for worldwide use. Therefore any value attributed to crypto is more of a bubble than actual value.
I don’t think he would care much if he loses it. He hasn’t changed a bit. In fact he is working more and more passionate about his project.
but you have to admit, I think his statement is what got him his wealth. Being a pioneer of invitation, wanting to create something meaningful usually comes with wealth.
The best way to ensure that it continues to be valuable is that there is some use of it outside of just hodling it.

People grab it and never respend it, which means that it has no safety net because not much relies on its transactions. 
To be fair he sold off a large portion of his Ethereum holdings some time ago. His net worth is based on a bit more than how much crypto he owns. 
Lol what would you rather him say, that we should only be focusing on pumping more money into it..?
Vitalik is not $ oriented lol, he's the opposite of that. Didn't he donate most of his coins? Also he mentioned that he's only willing to advise projects in which he believes will have a meaningful and positive impact to society.

This is someone who wants to help make this world better. 

He's a gift from the universe, an alien consciousness on earth who's mission is to help this planet.
Do you honestly believe Vitalik is motivated by financial wealth?! The guy is straight up doing this to make the world a better place. Whether this makes him rich or not. If you don' get that there's no helping you.
Cute, but breathtakingly obtuse.
Well technically achieving something meaningful will increase the value of cryptocurrency as a whole, so win win for everyone
His fault for creating something amazing and inadvertently profiting from it?  

He is right.  People are more focused on a quick profit.  Which is fine.  He wants people to thinking bigger as in broadening the scope of what we can do with the network and Blockchain in general.  
...it's easy to be a Buddhist when you're a millionaire.
Vitalik should probably explain why he bought hundreds of thousands of ETH in the beginning. In fact he should sell all his ETH to be a good example.
I was thinking the same thing. So many delusional rich people say this... 
Thanks to a massive pre-mine on ETH.
The profit motive is what is driving the technology into mainstream society. And it's not like the two are mutually exclusive anyways.
99% percent of meaningful development in society/history is/has been driven by some sort of profit. To quote a cliche, "Greed is good". Most things without profit are not sustainable long term. Yes, greed has created many bad things, but there are very, very few things that last without it generating a profit for someone.
Right, it seems clear that this is a giant bubble and is about to burst. 

I'm currently interested in the tech, not for the "pets.com"s which suddenly spike and then spectacularly fail in these infant years but for the next facebook/google to rise out of the ashes. Bitcoin itself looks a bit like myspace or askjeeves to me right now; a popular proof of concept which will eventually be dwarfed by a more lasting and refined global giant. While it is extremely popular right now, most people are not using bitcoin, there is absolutely massive potential for growth. 

I can't yet tell where eth will fall in this analogy. I think it's success or failure will depend on both it's continued basic development to support dapps and then development of a killer dapp.  
> capitalistic approach tries to ignore the source of our well being: labour, resources of raw materials, services

You obviously don't know much about business or a "capitalistic" approach.  

People in business care FAR MORE about those than most people, because for one, they are needed to make money obviously. 

Ever hear of business that wants shitty employees? Business wants good or the best employees. That means paying and treating good employees well. Tech companies for example,  invest a ton of money into employees... which means it's in the company's interest to retain them (or lose the money invested, leading to lower profits).

On the other hand, treating employees like shit (and having that reputation) leads to people leaving, company operations disrupted, company goals missed, potentially losing to competitors, lower stock value and thus... owners and managers making much LESS money than they could have.

Also, raw materials and labor are =major cost centers so a good business person has to maximize utility with them. If they don't then (1) they are losing money and potential profit, and (2) will lose to competitors who do maximize them, and (3) go out of business.... therefore, not making any money.

Go to the most successful businesses and they get high marks from employees, who also get high salaries/benefits.

As far as eating money-- Edibility doesn't matter. There are many productive things that I cannot eat. My computer is productive and I can't eat it. A house is useful and I can't eat it. Societies that productively allocate private capital/labor for profit (capitalist) never have had to eat money. 

There are flaws in the monetary system and they are directly caused by the government monopoly on money and collusion with banks, not businesses in general.
