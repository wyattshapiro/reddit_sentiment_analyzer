r/ethereum,"Vitalik Buterin: Cryptocurrency Should Focus Less on Profit, More on ""Achieving Something Meaningful""",1514570341,"I'm very happy that there are still people around like mr. Buterin, that realize that 'money' (be it fiat, crypto or bare gold) is nothing more than a practical exchange item. It has no value on it's own. 

Unfortunately the so called capitalistic approach tries to ignore the source of our well being: labour, resources of raw materials, services, ... and a lot of people talk like having money is being rich. Try eating money when you're hungry and you will see what I mean. There's an age old story about a king who wished everything he touches turned into gold. He died shortly after his wish was fulfilled...

I hope in deciding the future development of Ethereum, decisions will plain ignore the ideas of those who are in Ethereum pure as a money gaining investment. Decisions should be made to make the Ethereum blockchain as useable and practical as possible. 

If you look at Bitcoin on this moment: the value has risen not because it became so practical, but because it is failing. It is impossible that all the money pumped into BTC will ever get exchanged back to fiat. And I would not even think about accepting BTC as a means of payment for any goods or services I sell either.
Knowing that Bitcoin is no more than a means of exchange (for goods or other currency), everyone who is only a little sane can smell what will happen, unless Bitcoin can solve the problem of slowness & high fees in a very short term. If only a few people would have invested in bitcoins this wouldn't be a problem, but senseless 'popularity' drawed so much attention of people who actually have no clue, and only a few will make 'profit' at the end. Profit that in fact serves no one except those few...
Remember the economic value of something is nothing more than the price the biggest fool wants to pay for it... the real value is something you can't push.

The real value is only there if you can exchange the currency (fiat/crypto/anything else) for something you actually need. As long as it's a number in a graph, you can cheer as much as you want, you only cheer about air (well, actually about 'ether'/void, as air is something you actually need).

I hope the value of ETH will not rise the same way as bitcoin and instead it will become (or stay, imho;) the best worked out blockchain tech around (mainly due to it's founders actually having a view on how the world turns around). I see blockchain technology as an immature thing right now. Promises a lot, but we are not there yet. I hope mr. Buterin will keep up with the good work and will be able not to get demotivated by those who see Ethereum just as a method of gambling.",DoktorSultan,31,0,0.9944999999999999

Now it's time for devs and teams to take profits and start developing for the next couple years until the next wave of mainstream adoption.,Xueq,1,0,0.9467

I guess I'm out of here; I'm too poor to have the luxury of having those things. It doesn't matter how good my ideas and meaningful achievements are/can be if I'm starving on the street, or on the verge of being homeless. So many people went to college because they think they'll be achieving something meaningful end up being unhireable because they insist that they exist on the Earth not to be some drones on a corporate machine, but to ""Achieve Something Meaningful""- they may have dreams, but then they keep on dreaming, until they dream forever.

You obviously don't know much about business or a ""capitalistic"" approach.  

People in business care FAR MORE about those than most people, because for one, they are needed to make money obviously. 

Ever hear of business that wants shitty employees? Business wants good or the best employees. That means paying and treating good employees well. Tech companies for example,  invest a ton of money into employees... which means it's in the company's interest to retain them (or lose the money invested, leading to lower profits).

On the other hand, treating employees like shit (and having that reputation) leads to people leaving, company operations disrupted, company goals missed, potentially losing to competitors, lower stock value and thus... owners and managers making much LESS money than they could have.

Also, raw materials and labor are =major cost centers so a good business person has to maximize utility with them. If they don't then (1) they are losing money and potential profit, and (2) will lose to competitors who do maximize them, and (3) go out of business.... therefore, not making any money.

Go to the most successful businesses and they get high marks from employees, who also get high salaries/benefits.

As far as eating money-- Edibility doesn't matter. There are many productive things that I cannot eat. My computer is productive and I can't eat it. A house is useful and I can't eat it. Societies that productively allocate private capital/labor for profit (capitalist) never have had to eat money.

Buterin, that realize that 'money' (be it fiat, crypto or bare gold) is nothing more than a practical exchange item. It has no value on it's own. 

Unfortunately the so called capitalistic approach tries to ignore the source of our well being: labour, resources of raw materials, services, ... and a lot of people talk like having money is being rich. Try eating money when you're hungry and you will see what I mean. There's an age old story about a king who wished everything he touches turned into gold. He died shortly after his wish was fulfilled...

I hope in deciding the future development of Ethereum, decisions will plain ignore the ideas of those who are in Ethereum pure as a money gaining investment. Decisions should be made to make the Ethereum blockchain as useable and practical as possible. 

If you look at Bitcoin on this moment: the value has risen not because it became so practical, but because it is failing. It is impossible that all the money pumped into BTC will ever get exchanged back to fiat. And I would not even think about accepting BTC as a means of payment for any goods or services I sell either.
Knowing that Bitcoin is no more than a means of exchange (for goods or other currency), everyone who is only a little sane can smell what will happen, unless Bitcoin can solve the problem of slowness & high fees in a very short term. If only a few people would have invested in bitcoins this wouldn't be a problem, but senseless 'popularity' drawed so much attention of people who actually have no clue, and only a few will make 'profit' at the end. Profit that in fact serves no one except those few...
Remember the economic value of something is nothing more than the price the biggest fool wants to pay for it... the real value is something you can't push.

The real value is only there if you can exchange the currency (fiat/crypto/anything else) for something you actually need. As long as it's a number in a graph, you can cheer as much as you want, you only cheer about air (well, actually about 'ether'/void, as air is something you actually need).

I hope the value of ETH will not rise the same way as bitcoin and instead it will become (or stay, imho;) the best worked out blockchain tech around (mainly due to it's founders actually having a view on how the world turns around). I see blockchain technology as an immature thing right now. Promises a lot, but we are not there yet. I hope mr.

That's extremely dangerous.

I've been saying it for a while but I do not see a real use case currently for Bitcoin. There are a few stores in Japan that accept Bitcoin but if that is their use case, then it's basically competing with the Suica card system that's already in place and already accepted for purchasing as well.

Also, why should anyone invest in one particular crypto over another? With hard currencies, you're betting on the stability and growth of a particular country's economy. With crypto, it is.... What?

Finally, what does it mean to actually buy crypto? To invest? But again, there isn't much hard real world value you're investing in: it's like investing in a startup that does nothing but have other investors invest in it.

Even though crypto has phenominal returns, I would never invest because I personally do not understand the value behind it.",YC_SP,0,0,0.9648

r/ethereum,"Vitalik Buterin: Cryptocurrency Should Focus Less on Profit, More on ""Achieving Something Meaningful""",1514622081,"> capitalistic approach tries to ignore the source of our well being: labour, resources of raw materials, services

You obviously don't know much about business or a ""capitalistic"" approach.  

People in business care FAR MORE about those than most people, because for one, they are needed to make money obviously. 

Ever hear of business that wants shitty employees? Business wants good or the best employees. That means paying and treating good employees well. Tech companies for example,  invest a ton of money into employees... which means it's in the company's interest to retain them (or lose the money invested, leading to lower profits).

On the other hand, treating employees like shit (and having that reputation) leads to people leaving, company operations disrupted, company goals missed, potentially losing to competitors, lower stock value and thus... owners and managers making much LESS money than they could have.

Also, raw materials and labor are =major cost centers so a good business person has to maximize utility with them. If they don't then (1) they are losing money and potential profit, and (2) will lose to competitors who do maximize them, and (3) go out of business.... therefore, not making any money.

Go to the most successful businesses and they get high marks from employees, who also get high salaries/benefits.

As far as eating money-- Edibility doesn't matter. There are many productive things that I cannot eat. My computer is productive and I can't eat it. A house is useful and I can't eat it.

r/ethereum,"Vitalik Buterin: Cryptocurrency Should Focus Less on Profit, More on ""Achieving Something Meaningful""",1514570341,"I'm very happy that there are still people around like mr. Buterin, that realize that 'money' (be it fiat, crypto or bare gold) is nothing more than a practical exchange item. It has no value on it's own. 

Unfortunately the so called capitalistic approach tries to ignore the source of our well being: labour, resources of raw materials, services, ... and a lot of people talk like having money is being rich. Try eating money when you're hungry and you will see what I mean. There's an age old story about a king who wished everything he touches turned into gold. He died shortly after his wish was fulfilled...

I hope in deciding the future development of Ethereum, decisions will plain ignore the ideas of those who are in Ethereum pure as a money gaining investment. Decisions should be made to make the Ethereum blockchain as useable and practical as possible. 

If you look at Bitcoin on this moment: the value has risen not because it became so practical, but because it is failing. It is impossible that all the money pumped into BTC will ever get exchanged back to fiat. And I would not even think about accepting BTC as a means of payment for any goods or services I sell either.
Knowing that Bitcoin is no more than a means of exchange (for goods or other currency), everyone who is only a little sane can smell what will happen, unless Bitcoin can solve the problem of slowness & high fees in a very short term. If only a few people would have invested in bitcoins this wouldn't be a problem, but senseless 'popularity' drawed so much attention of people who actually have no clue, and only a few will make 'profit' at the end. Profit that in fact serves no one except those few...
Remember the economic value of something is nothing more than the price the biggest fool wants to pay for it... the real value is something you can't push.

The real value is only there if you can exchange the currency (fiat/crypto/anything else) for something you actually need. As long as it's a number in a graph, you can cheer as much as you want, you only cheer about air (well, actually about 'ether'/void, as air is something you actually need).

I hope the value of ETH will not rise the same way as bitcoin and instead it will become (or stay, imho;) the best worked out blockchain tech around (mainly due to it's founders actually having a view on how the world turns around). I see blockchain technology as an immature thing right now. Promises a lot, but we are not there yet. I hope mr.

You obviously don't know much about business or a ""capitalistic"" approach.  

People in business care FAR MORE about those than most people, because for one, they are needed to make money obviously. 

Ever hear of business that wants shitty employees? Business wants good or the best employees. That means paying and treating good employees well. Tech companies for example,  invest a ton of money into employees... which means it's in the company's interest to retain them (or lose the money invested, leading to lower profits).

On the other hand, treating employees like shit (and having that reputation) leads to people leaving, company operations disrupted, company goals missed, potentially losing to competitors, lower stock value and thus... owners and managers making much LESS money than they could have.

Also, raw materials and labor are =major cost centers so a good business person has to maximize utility with them. If they don't then (1) they are losing money and potential profit, and (2) will lose to competitors who do maximize them, and (3) go out of business.... therefore, not making any money.

Go to the most successful businesses and they get high marks from employees, who also get high salaries/benefits.

As far as eating money-- Edibility doesn't matter. There are many productive things that I cannot eat. My computer is productive and I can't eat it. A house is useful and I can't eat it. Societies that productively allocate private capital/labor for profit (capitalist) never have had to eat money.

Buterin, that realize that 'money' (be it fiat, crypto or bare gold) is nothing more than a practical exchange item. It has no value on it's own. 

Unfortunately the so called capitalistic approach tries to ignore the source of our well being: labour, resources of raw materials, services, ... and a lot of people talk like having money is being rich. Try eating money when you're hungry and you will see what I mean. There's an age old story about a king who wished everything he touches turned into gold. He died shortly after his wish was fulfilled...

I hope in deciding the future development of Ethereum, decisions will plain ignore the ideas of those who are in Ethereum pure as a money gaining investment. Decisions should be made to make the Ethereum blockchain as useable and practical as possible. 

If you look at Bitcoin on this moment: the value has risen not because it became so practical, but because it is failing. It is impossible that all the money pumped into BTC will ever get exchanged back to fiat. And I would not even think about accepting BTC as a means of payment for any goods or services I sell either.
Knowing that Bitcoin is no more than a means of exchange (for goods or other currency), everyone who is only a little sane can smell what will happen, unless Bitcoin can solve the problem of slowness & high fees in a very short term. If only a few people would have invested in bitcoins this wouldn't be a problem, but senseless 'popularity' drawed so much attention of people who actually have no clue, and only a few will make 'profit' at the end. Profit that in fact serves no one except those few...
Remember the economic value of something is nothing more than the price the biggest fool wants to pay for it... the real value is something you can't push.

The real value is only there if you can exchange the currency (fiat/crypto/anything else) for something you actually need. As long as it's a number in a graph, you can cheer as much as you want, you only cheer about air (well, actually about 'ether'/void, as air is something you actually need).

I hope the value of ETH will not rise the same way as bitcoin and instead it will become (or stay, imho;) the best worked out blockchain tech around (mainly due to it's founders actually having a view on how the world turns around). I see blockchain technology as an immature thing right now. Promises a lot, but we are not there yet. I hope mr.

All of it is giving the younger generations a greater chance to understand the underlying mechanisms at play in this world through a greater transparency of systems of scalability.  This whole universe is energy and there's many different forms of 'coin' that energy comes in.  Learning these dynamics are spiritually enlightening to me.  It's kind of nice to be able to profit while learning and so it's meaningful to me.  If others miss this message for the sake of profit, well that's their loss.

Also, why should anyone invest in one particular crypto over another? With hard currencies, you're betting on the stability and growth of a particular country's economy. With crypto, it is.... What?

Finally, what does it mean to actually buy crypto? To invest? But again, there isn't much hard real world value you're investing in: it's like investing in a startup that does nothing but have other investors invest in it.

You obviously don't know much about business or a ""capitalistic"" approach.  

People in business care FAR MORE about those than most people, because for one, they are needed to make money obviously. 

Ever hear of business that wants shitty employees? Business wants good or the best employees. That means paying and treating good employees well. Tech companies for example,  invest a ton of money into employees... which means it's in the company's interest to retain them (or lose the money invested, leading to lower profits).

On the other hand, treating employees like shit (and having that reputation) leads to people leaving, company operations disrupted, company goals missed, potentially losing to competitors, lower stock value and thus... owners and managers making much LESS money than they could have.

Also, raw materials and labor are =major cost centers so a good business person has to maximize utility with them. If they don't then (1) they are losing money and potential profit, and (2) will lose to competitors who do maximize them, and (3) go out of business.... therefore, not making any money.

Go to the most successful businesses and they get high marks from employees, who also get high salaries/benefits.

As far as eating money-- Edibility doesn't matter. There are many productive things that I cannot eat. My computer is productive and I can't eat it. A house is useful and I can't eat it. Societies that productively allocate private capital/labor for profit (capitalist) never have had to eat money. 

There are flaws in the monetary system and they are directly caused by the government monopoly on money and collusion with banks, not businesses in general.",superportal,1,0,0.97665

As 98% of so called ""investors"" just *buy but never use* the different crypto tokens. Remember the days when the bitcoin subreddit told you: ""Once the price hits the moon,  you won't need to exchange back to fiat""?
See where this lead to in 2017: Prices close to the moon for all major tokens and the biggest achievement we got in terms of use cases are cryptokitties on ethereum and 30$ transaction costs on the bitcoin Blockchain and shady gambling sites.

The price is driven purely by greed and speculation. The technology itself is not worth these billion dollars and I honestly doubt that more than 20% of the ""investors"" even understand the most basic underlying principles.
